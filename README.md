Modern software heavily depends on open-source libraries. While these packages speed up development, they also introduce security risks.
The Dependency Security Auditor is a Python-based tool designed to automatically scan a project's dependency list (requirements.txt) and identify known security vulnerabilities using the OSV (Open Source Vulnerability) API.
It provides a clean Tkinter GUI, making it easy for students, developers, and small teams to audit dependencies without complex setups.
